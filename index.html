                    <h1>The following list is a time line of Andrew Carnegie</h1>
                    <p>Carnegie led the expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century and became one of the richest Americans in history.[5] He became a leading philanthropist in the United States and in the British Empire. During the last 18 years of his life, he gave away around $350 million (roughly $5.2 billion in 2020),[6] almost 90 percent of his fortune, to charities, foundations and universities.[7] His 1889 article proclaiming "The Gospel of Wealth" called on the rich to use their wealth to improve society, expressed support for progressive taxation and an estate tax, and stimulated a wave of philanthropy. </p>
